# wordpress-theme-code
Code for showing categories, up to three in a row. If that number exceeds, a new row will automatically show more categories. Comments are in swedish.

This is originally code I came up with for a project I made in one of the courses, that was part of my web development education. The specific course was about WordPress, and we learnt how to build a theme for it.
